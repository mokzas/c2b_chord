## ✨ Features
Ever thought **"I definitely know how to play this chord..."**?

The reason why a chord that felt natural in one song suddenly feels awkward in another is because you didn't truly master the chord itself—you just memorized the finger patterns.

Chordra mixes your selected chords randomly, so you can build **real chord skills** instead of just pattern memorization.
