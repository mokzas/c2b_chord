## ✨ Features
Ever thought **"I definitely know how to play this chord..."**?

The reason why a chord that felt natural in one song suddenly feels awkward in another is because you didn't truly master the chord itself—you just memorized the finger patterns.

Chordra mixes your selected chords randomly, so you can build **real chord skills** instead of just pattern memorization.

#### 🎯 **Chord Selection** 

Choose the chords you struggle with most.

Use filters like root, triad, 7th, extension, or alteration to find exactly what you need.

#### 🎲 **Practice Screen**  

Randomly displays chords from your selection on screen. Test your real skills with unpredictable progressions.

#### ⏯ **Metronome**  

Practice with real-time rhythm like you're performing live. Pause to stop mid-progression, or stop to restart from the beginning.

#### 🔁 **Loop Mode for Tough Progressions**  

Repeat the current chord progression on screen. Master difficult chord combinations through focused repetition.
